    * - `Feature store querying <https://github.com/oracle-samples/oci-data-science-ai-samples/blob/main/notebook_examples/feature_store_querying.ipynb>`__
      - | * Ingestion of data.
        | * Querying and exploration of data.

    * - `Feature store quickstart <https://github.com/oracle-samples/oci-data-science-ai-samples/blob/main/notebook_examples/feature_store_quickstart.ipynb>`__
      - | * Ingestion of data.
        | * Querying and exploration of data.

    * - `Big data operations with feature store <https://github.com/oracle-samples/oci-data-science-ai-samples/blob/main/notebook_examples/feature_store_spark_magic.ipynb>`__
      - | * Ingestion of data using Spark Magic.
        | * Querying and exploration of data using Spark Magic.

    * - `Schema enforcement and schema evolution <https://github.com/oracle-samples/oci-data-science-ai-samples/blob/main/notebook_examples/feature_store_schema_evolution.ipynb>`__
      - | * ``Schema evolution`` allows you to easily change a table's current schema to accommodate data that is changing over time.
        | * ``Schema enforcement``, also known as schema validation, is a safeguard in Delta Lake that ensures data quality by rejecting writes to a table that don't match the table's schema.

    * - `Embeddings in Feature Store <https://github.com/oracle-samples/oci-data-science-ai-samples/blob/main/notebook_examples/feature_store_embeddings.ipynb>`__
      - | * ``Embedding feature stores`` are optimized for fast and efficient retrieval of embeddings. This is important because embeddings can be high-dimensional and computationally expensive to calculate. By storing them in a dedicated store, you can avoid the need to recalculate embeddings for the same data repeatedly.
