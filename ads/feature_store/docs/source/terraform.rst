Terraform: Setting Up a Feature Store
=====================================

The following shows a terraform stack deployment of the feature store resources.

Blue-green deployment is a strategy for releasing new versions of an application with minimal downtime and risk. It is used in Kubernetes, and other deployment environments, to achieve a smooth transition between application versions with the ability to quickly rollback if issues are detected. In a blue-green deployment, there are two environments named blue and green that run concurrently. One environment is designated as the live or production environment called blue. While the other environment, named green, is idle or running a newer version of the application for testing. Both environments have identical configurations and infrastructure.

.. _User Policies:

Required Policies for a Terraform Stack
=======================================

Feature store requires the following policy statements to deploy the feature store in a Terraform stack:

..  code-block:: shell

    define tenancy service_tenancy as ocid1.tenancy.oc1..aaaaaaaa462hfhplpx652b32ix62xrdijppq2c7okwcqjlgrbknhgtj2kofa
    endorse group <feature store user group> to read repos in tenancy service_tenancy
    allow group <feature store user group> to manage orm-stacks in compartment <compartmentName>
    allow group <feature store user group> to manage orm-jobs in compartment <compartmentName>
    allow group <feature store user group> to manage object-family in compartment <compartmentName>
    allow group <feature store user group> to manage users in compartment <compartmentName>
    allow group <feature store user group> to manage instance-family in compartment <compartmentName>
    allow group <feature store user group> to manage tag-namespaces in compartment <compartmentName>
    allow group <feature store user group> to manage groups in compartment <compartmentName>
    allow group <feature store user group> to manage policies in compartment <compartmentName>
    allow group <feature store user group> to manage dynamic-groups in compartment <compartmentName>
    allow group <feature store user group> to manage virtual-network-family in compartment <compartmentName>
    allow group <feature store user group> to manage functions-family in compartment <compartmentName>
    allow group <feature store user group> to inspect compartments in compartment <compartmentName>

    allow group <feature store user group> to manage mysql-family in compartment <compartmentName>
    allow group <feature store user group> to manage api-gateway-family in compartment <compartmentName>

No policies are explicitly required for administrator users.

Deploy Using Oracle Resource Manager
====================================

If you aren't already signed in, enter the tenancy and user credentials. Review and accept the terms and conditions. Review the :ref:`Release Notes` to obtain the latest conda environment and ``SERVICE_VERSION``.

1. Ensure that you have the required policy statements.

2. Download the stack from the ``Terraform Stack`` column in the :ref:`Release Notes`.

3. Click to deploy the stack.

4. Select the region and compartment where you want to deploy the stack.

5. Follow the prompts and instructions to create the stack.

6. After creating the stack, click **Terraform Actions**, and select **Plan**.

7. Wait for the job to complet, and then review the plan.

8. To make changes return to the Stack Details page, click **Edit Stack**, and make the required changes. Then run the Plan action again.

9. If no further changes are necessary, return to the Stack Details page, click **Terraform Actions**, and click **Apply**.

User VCN Deployment
===================
Bring your own database (BYODB) is not supported by feature store because it doesn't support private access using a private endpoint and private access gateway for ATP instances.

You can specify VCN details for the feature store to use an existing VCN. A Terraform stack feature store has the following Terraform VCN variables:

    .. list-table::
       :header-rows: 1

         - 'ocid1.dhcpoptions.oc1.iad.xxxxxxxxx'
         - DHCP options OCID is required for instance configuration within the VCN.
       * - `igw_id`
         - `ocid1.internetgateway.oc1.iad.xxxxxxxxxxxx`
         - Optional. The internet gateway OCID. Feature store creates the IGW if not specified.
       * - `nat_gw_id`
         - `ocid1.natgateway.oc1.iad.xxxxxxxxxx`
         - Optional. The NAT gateway OCID. The feature store creates the NAT gateway if not specified.
       * - `sgw_id`
         - `ocid1.servicegateway.oc1.iad.xxxxxxxxxx`
         - Optional. The feature store gateway OCID. Feature store doesn't create SGW even when its null, or doesn't enable SGW until the time you explicitly set using sgw_enable. This ensures that SGW is only enabled for network resources (ATP for example) that allow access through SGW.
       * - `sgw_enable`
         - `false`
         - Enable service gateway use or creation depending on the sgw_id specified.
       * - `private_route_table_id`
         - `ocid1.routetable.oc1.iad.xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx`
         - Optional. The private route table OCID. Ensure that the NAT gateway and feature store gateway (if applicable) route rules have been added for feature store access. The feature store creates a private route table with supporting route rules if not specified.
       * - `public_route_table_id`
         - `ocid1.routetable.oc1.iad.xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx`
         - Optional. The public route table OCID. Ensure that the internet gateway route rule are added for feature store access. The feature store creates a public route table with supporting route rules if not specified.

    Feature store is deployed in feature store specific subnets and security list access is maintained on the basis of details specified.
