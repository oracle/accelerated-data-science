* Added a method to report the difference between the optimal and current best score for ``ADSTuner`` tuning processes with score-based stopping criteria.
* Added caching for model loading method to avoid model deserialization each time the predict method is called.
* Made the list of supported formats in ``DatasetFactory.open()`` more explicit.
* Moved the ``ADSEvaluator`` caption to above the table.
* Added a warning message in the ``get_recommendations()`` method when no recommendations can be made.
* Added a parameter in ``print_summary()`` to display the ranking table only.
* ``list_apps`` in the ``DataFlow`` class supports the optional parameter ``compartment_id``.
* An exception occurs when using SVC or KNN on large datasets in ``OracleAutoMLProvider``.
* Speed improvements in correlation calculations.
* Improved the name of the y-axis label in ``feature_selection_trials()``.
* Automatically chooses the y-label based on the ``score_metric`` set in ``train`` if you don't set it.
* Increased the default timeout for uploading models to the model catalog.
* Improved the module documentation.
* Speed improvements in ``get_recommendations()`` on wide datasets.
* Speed improvements in ``DatasetFactory.open()``.

* Added the ability to have defaults and to provide authentication information while instantiating a Provider Class.
* Added a larger time buffer for the ``plot_param_importance`` method.
* Migrated the ``DatasetFactory`` reading engine from Dask to Pandas.
* Enabling Pandas to read lists and glob of files.
* ``DatasetFactory`` now supports reading from Object Storage using ``ocifs``.
* The ``DatasetFactory`` URI pattern now supports namespaces and follows the HDFS Connector format.
* The ``url()`` method can generate PARs for Object Storage objects.
* ``DatasetFactory`` now has caching for Object Storage operations.

The following issues were fixed:

* Issue with multipart upload and download in ``DatasetFactory``.
* Issues with log level in ``OracleAutoMLProvider``.
* Issue with ``fill_value`` when running ``get_recommendations()``.
* Issue with an invalid training path when saving model provenance.
* Issue with errors during model deletion.
* Issues with deep copying ``ADSData``.
* Evaluation plot KeyError.
* Dataset ``show_in_notebook`` issue.
* Inconsistency in preparing ``ADSModels`` and generic models.
* Issue with ``force_overwrite`` in ``prepare_generic_model`` not being properly triggered.
* Issue with ``OracleAutoMLProvider`` failing to ``visualize_tuning_trials``.
* Issues with ``model_prepare`` trying to do feature transforms on keras and pytorch models.
* Erroneous creation of ``__pychache__``.
* The ``AttributeError`` message when an ``ApplicationSummary`` or ``RunSummary`` object is being displayed in a notebook.
* Issues with newer versions of Dask breaking ``DatasetFactory``.

AutoML is upgraded to AutoML v1.0 and the changes include:

* Switched to using Pandas Dataframes internally. AutoML now uses Pandas dataframes internally instead of Numpy dataframes, avoiding needless conversions.
* Pytorch is now an optional dependency. If Pytorch is installed, AutoML automatically considers multilayer perceptrons in its search. If Pytorch is not found, deep learning models are ignored.
* Updated the Pipeline interface to include ``train()``, which runs all the pipeline stages though doesn't do the final fitting of the model ( ``fit()`` API should be used if the final fit is needed).
* Updated the Pipeline interface to include ``refit()`` to allow you to refit the pipeline to an updated dataset without re-running the full pipeline again. We recommend this for advanced users only. For best results, we recommended that you rerun the full pipeline when the dataset changes.
* AutoML now reports memory usage for each trial as a part of its trial attributes. This information relies on the maximum resident size metric reported by Linux, and can sometimes be unreliable.
* ``holidays`` is now an optional dependency. If ``holidays`` is installed, AutoML automatically uses it to add ``holidays`` as a feature for engineering datetime columns.
* Added support for Anomaly Detection and Forecasting tasks (experimental).
* Downcast dataset to reduce pipeline training memory consumption.
* Set numpy BLAS parallelism to 1 to avoid CPU over subscription.
* Created interactive example notebooks for all supported tasks (classification, regression, anomaly detection, and forecasting), see http://automl.oraclecorp.com/.
* Other general bug fixes.

January 13, 2021
-----------------

* A full distribution of this release of ADS is found in the General Machine Learning for CPU and GPU environments. The Classic environments include the previous release of ADS.
* A distribution of ADS without AutoML and MLX is found in the remaining environments.
* ``DatasetFactory`` can now download files first before opening them in memory using the ``.download()`` method.
* Added support to archive files in creating Data Flow applications and runs.
* Support was added for loading Avro format data into ADS.
* Changed model serialization to use ONNX by default when possible on supported models.
* Added ``ADSTuner``, which is a framework and model agnostic hyperparmater optimizer, use the ``adstuner.ipynb`` notebook for examples of how to use this feature.
* Corrected the ``up_sample()`` method in ``get_recommendations()`` so that it does not fail when all features are categorical. Up-sampling is possible for datasets containing continuous and categorical features.
* Resolved issues with serializing ``ndarray`` objects into JSON.
* A table of all of the ADS notebook examples can be found in our service documentation: `Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Data Science <https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/data-science/using/use-notebook-sessions.htm#conda_understand_environments>`__
* Changed ``set_documentation_mode`` to false by default.
* Added unit-tests related to the dataset helper.
* Fixed the ``_check_object_exists`` to handle situations where the object storage bucket has more than 1000 objects.
* Added option ``overwrite_script`` in the ``create_app()`` method to allow a user to override a pre-existing file.
* Added support for newer fsspec versions.
* Added support for the C library Snappy.
* Fixed issue with uploading model provenance data due to inconsistency with OCI interface.
* Resolved issue with multiple versions of Cryptography being installed when installing fbprophet.

AutoML is upgraded to AutoML v0.5.2 and the changes include:

* AutoML is now distributed in the General Machine Learning and Data Exploration conda environments.
* Support for ONNX. AutoML models can now be serialized using ONNX by calling the ``to_onnx()`` API on the AutoML estimator.
* Pre-processing has been overhauled to use ``sklearn`` pipelines to allow serialization using ONNX. Numerical, categorical, and text columns are supported for ONNX serialization. Datetime and time series columns are not supported.
* Torch-based deep learning models, TorchMLPClassifier and TorchMLPRegressor, have been added.
* GPU support for XGBoost and torch-based models have been added. This is disabled by default and can be enabled by passing in ``‘gpu_id’: ‘auto’`` in ``engine_opts`` in the constructor. ONNX serialization for GPUs has not been tested.
* Adaptive sampling’s learning curve has been smoothened. This allows adaptive sampling to converge faster on some datasets.
* Improvements to ranking performance in feature selection were added. Feature selection is now much faster on large datasets.
* The default execution engine for AutoML has been switched to Dask. You can still use the Python multiprocessing by passing ``engine='local', engine_opts={'n_jobs' : -1}`` to ``init()``
* GuassianNB has been enabled in the interface by default.
* The ``AdaBoostClassifier`` has been disabled in the pipeline-interface by default. The ONNX converter for ``AdaBoost`` should not be used.
* The issue ``ValueError: Found unknown categories during transform`` has been fixed.
* You can manually specify a hyperparameter search space to AutoML. A new parameter was added to the pipeline. This allows you to freeze some hyperparameters or to expose further ones for tuning.
* New API: Refit an AutoML pipeline to another dataset. This is primarily used to handle updated training data, where you train the pipeline once, and refit in on newer data.
* AutoML no longer closes a user-specified Dask cluster.
* AutoML properly cleans up any existing futures on the Dask cluster at the end of fit.

MLX is upgraded to MLX v1.0.16 the changes include:

* MLX is now distributed in the General Machine Learning conda environments.
* Updated the explanation descriptions to use a base64 representation of the static plots. This obviates the need for creating a ``mlx_static`` directory.
* Replaced the boolean indexing in slicing Pandas dataFrame with integer indexing. After updating to ``Pandas >= 1.1.0`` the boolean indexing caused some issues. Integer indexing addresses these issues.
* Fixed MLX-related import warnings.
* Corrected an issue with ALE when the target values are strings.
* Removed the dependency on Paramiko.
* Addresses an issue with ALE when the target values are not of type ``list``.

August 11, 2020
---------------

* Support was added to use resource principles as an authentication mechanism for ADS.
* Support was added to MLX for an additional model explanation diagnostic, Accumulated Local Effects (ALEs).
* Support was added to MLX for "What-if" scenarios in model explainability.
* Improvements were made to the correlation heatmap calculations in ``show_in_notebook()``.
* Improvements were made to the model artifact.

The following bugs were fixed:

* Data Flow applications inherit the compartment assignment of the client. Runs inherit from applications by default. Compartment OCIDs can also be specified independently at the client, application, and run levels.
* The Data Flow log link for logs pulled from an application loaded into the notebook session is fixed.
* Progress bars now complete fully (in ``ADSModel.prepare()`` and ``prepare_generic_model()``).
* ``BaselineModel`` is now significantly faster and can be opted out of.

MLX upgraded to MLX v1.0.10 the changes include:

* Added support to specify the mlx_static root path (used for ALE summary).
* Added support for making mlx_static directory hidden (for example, <path>/.mlx_static/).
* Fixed issue with the boolean features in ALE.

June 9, 2020
------------

Numerous bug fixes including:

* Support for Data Flow applications and runs outside of a notebook session compartment. Support for specific object storage logs and script buckets at the application and run levels.
* ADS detects small shapes and gives warnings for AutoML execution.
* Removal of triggers in the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Functions ``func.yaml`` file.
* ``DatasetFactory.open()`` incorrectly yielding a classification dataset for a continuous target was fixed.
* ``LabelEncoder`` producing the wrong results for category and object columns was fixed.
* An untrusted notebook issue when running model explanation visualizations were fixed.
* A warning about adaptive sampling requiring at least 1000 data points was added.
* A dtype cast float to integer into ``DatasetFactory.open("csv")`` was added.
* An option to specify the bucket of Data Flow logs when you create the application was added.

AutoML upgraded to 0.4.2 the changes include:

* Reduced parallelization on low compute hardware.
* Support for passing in a custom logger object in ``automl.init(logger=)``.
* Support for ``datetime`` columns. AutoML should automatically infer ``datetime`` columns based on the Pandas dataframe, and perform feature engineering on them. This can also be forced by using the ``col_types`` argument in ``pipeline.fit()``. The supported types are: ``['categorical', 'numerical', 'datetime']``

MLX upgraded to MLX 1.0.7 the changes include:

* Updated the feature distributions in the PDP/ICE plots (performance improvement).
* All distributions are now shown as PMFs. Categorical features show the category frequency and continuous features are computed using a NumPy histogram (with ‘auto’). They are also separate sub-plots, which are interactive.
* Classification PDP: The y-axis for continuous features is now auto-scaled (not fixed to 0-1).
* 1-feature PDP/ICE: The x-axis for continuous features now shows the entire feature distribution, whereas the plot may show a subset depending on the ``partial_range`` parameter (for example, ``partial_range=[0.2, 0.8]`` computes the PDP between the 20th and 80th percentile. The plot now shows the full distribution on the x-axis, but the line charts are only drawn between the specified percentile ranges).
* 2-feature PDP: The plot x and y axes are now auto-set to match the ``partial_range`` specified by the user. This ensures that the heatmap fills the entire plot by default. However, the entire feature distribution can be viewed by zooming out or clicking Autoscale in plotly.
* Support for plotting scatter plots using WebGL (``show_in_notebook(..., use_webgl=True)``) was added.
* The side issues that were causing the MLX Visualization Omitted warnings in JupyterLab were fixed.

April 30, 2020
--------------

* ADS integration with the `Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Data Flow <https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/data-flow/using/dfs_getting_started.htm>`__ service provides a more efficient and convenient to launch a Spark application and run Spark jobs
* ``show_in_notebook()`` has had "head" removed from accordion and is replaced with dataset "warnings".
* ``get_recommendations()`` is deprecated and replaced with ``suggest_recommendations()``, which returns a Pandas dataframe with all the recommendations and suggested code to implement each action.
* A progress indication of `Autonomous Data Warehouse <https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Database/Concepts/adboverview.htm>`__ reads has been added.

AutoML updated to version 0.4.1 from 0.3.1:

* More consistent handling of stratification and random state.
* Bug-fix for ``LightGBM`` and ``XGBoost`` crashing on AMD shapes was implemented.
* Unified Proxy Models across all stages of the AutoML Pipeline, ensuring leaderboard rankings are consistent was implemented.
* Remove visual option from the interface.
* The default tuning metric for both binary and multi-class classification has been changed to ``neg_log_loss``.
* Bug-fix in AutoML ``XGBoost``, where the predicted probabilities were sometimes NaN, was implemented.
* Fixed several corner case issues in Hyperparameter Optimization.

MLX updated to version 1.0.3 from 1.0.0:

* Added support for specifying the 'average' parameter in ``sklearn`` metrics by ``<metric>_<average>``, for examlple ``F1_avg``.
* Fixed an issue with the detailed scatter plot visualizations and cutoff feature/axis names.
* Fixed an issue with the balanced sampling in the Global Feature Permutation Importance explainer.
* Updated the supported scoring metrics in MLX. The ``PermutationImportance`` explainer now supports a large number of classification and regression metrics. Also, many of the metrics' names were changed.
* Updated LIME and ``PermutationImportance`` explainer descriptions.
* Fixed an issue where ``sklearn.pipeline`` wasn't imported.
* Fixed deprecated ``asscalar`` warnings.

.. admonition:: Access to ADW performance has been improved significantly

  Major improvements were made to the performance of the ADW ``dataset loader``. Your data is now loaded much faster, depending on your environment.


.. admonition:: Change to DatasetFactory.open() with ADW

  ``DatasetFactory.open()`` with ``format='sql'`` no longer requires the ``index_col`` to be specified. This was confusing, since "index" means something very different in databases. Additionally, the ``table`` parameter may now be either a table or a ``sql`` expression.

  .. code-block:: python3

    ds = DatasetFactory.open(
      connection_string,
      format = 'sql',
      table = """
        SELECT *
        FROM sh.times
        WHERE rownum <= 30
      """
    )

.. admonition:: No longer automatically starts an H2O cluster

  ADS no longer instantiates an H2O cluster on behalf of the user. Instead, you need to ``import h2o`` on your own and then start your own cluster.

.. admonition:: Profiling Dask APIs

  With support for Bokeh extension, you can now profile Dask operations and visualize profiler output. For more details, see `Dask ResourceProfiler <https://docs.dask.org/en/latest/diagnostics-local.html#resourceprofiler>`__.

  You can use the ``ads.common.analyzer.resource_analyze`` decorator to visualize the CPU and memory utilization of operations.

  During execution, it records the following information for each timestep:

  * Time in seconds since the epoch
  * Memory usage in MB
  * % CPU usage

  Example:

  .. code-block:: python3

    from ads.common.analyzer import resource_analyze
    from ads.dataset.dataset_browser import DatasetBrowser
    @resource_analyze
    def fetch_data():
        sklearn = DatasetBrowser.sklearn()
        wine_ds = sklearn.open('wine').set_target("target")
        return wine_ds
    fetch_data()

  The output shows two lines, one for the total CPU percentage used by all the workers, and one for total memory used.

.. admonition:: Dask Upgrade

  Dask is updated to version 2.10.1 with support for Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Object Storage. The 2.10.1 version provides better performance than the older version.
