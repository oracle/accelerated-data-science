* Data Flow requires a bucket to store the logs, and a data warehouse bucket. Refer to the Data Flow documentation for `setting up storage <https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/data-flow/using/dfs_getting_started.htm#set_up_storage>`_.
* Data Flow requires policies to be set in IAM to access resources to manage and run applications/sessions. Refer to the Data Flow documentation on how to `setup policies <https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/data-flow/using/dfs_getting_started.htm#policy_set_up>`__.
* Data Flow natively supports conda packs published to OCI Object Storage. Ensure the Data Flow Resource has read access to the bucket or path of your published conda pack, and that the spark version >= 3 when running your Data Flow Application/Session.
