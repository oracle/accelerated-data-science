   :class: note

  Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) Data Flow is a fully managed, serverless, and on-demand Apache Spark Service that performs data processing or model training tasks on extremely large datasets without infrastructure to deploy or manage.

  `Getting Started with Data Flow <https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/data-flow/using/dfs_getting_started.htm>`_

``ads`` integrates with OCI Data Flow allowing users to submit and monitor Spark jobs from Notebook Sessions or from their local machine.
