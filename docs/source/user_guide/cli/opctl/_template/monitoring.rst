Monitoring With CLI
===================


+++++
watch
+++++

You can tail the logs generated by ``OCI Data Science Job Runs`` or ``OCI Data Flow Application Runs`` using the ``watch`` subcommand.

.. code-block:: shell
  
  ads opctl watch <job run ocid or dataflow application run ocid>

This command requires an api key or resource principal setup. The logs are streamed from the logging service. If your job is not attached to logging service, this option will show only the lifecycle state.
