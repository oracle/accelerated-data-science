ScriptRuntime
=============

The ``ScriptRuntime`` class is designed for you to define job artifacts and configurations supported by OCI Data Science jobs natively.  It can be used with any script types that is supported by the OCI Data Science jobs, including a ZIP or compressed tar file or folder.  See `Preparing Job Artifacts <https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/data-science/using/jobs-artifact.htm>`__ for more details.  In the job run, the working directory is the user's home directory. For example ``/home/datascience``.

Python
------

If you are in a notebook session, ADS can automatically fetch the infrastructure configurations, and use them in the job. If you aren't in a notebook session or you want to customize the infrastructure, you can specify them using the methods in the ``DataScienceJob`` class.

With the ``ScriptRuntime``, you can pass in a path to a ZIP file or directory.  For a ZIP file, the path can be any URI supported by `fsspec <https://filesystem-spec.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`__, including OCI Object Storage.

You must specify the ``entrypoint``, which is the relative path from the ZIP file or directory to the script starting your program. Note that the ``entrypoint`` contains the name of the directory, since the directory itself is also zipped as the job artifact.

.. code-block:: python3

  from ads.jobs import Job, DataScienceJob, ScriptRuntime

  job = (
    Job()
    .with_infrastructure(
      DataScienceJob()
      .with_log_group_id("<log_group_ocid>")
      .with_log_id("<log_ocid>")
      # The following infrastructure configurations are optional
      # if you are in an OCI data science notebook session.
      # The configurations of the notebook session will be used as defaults
      .with_compartment_id("<compartment_ocid>")
      .with_project_id("<project_ocid>")
      .with_subnet_id("<subnet_ocid>")
      .with_shape_name("VM.Standard.E3.Flex")
      .with_shape_config_details(memory_in_gbs=16, ocpus=1)
      .with_block_storage_size(50)
    )
    .with_runtime(
      ScriptRuntime()
      .with_source("path/to/zip_or_dir", entrypoint="zip_or_dir/main.py")
      .with_service_conda("pytorch19_p37_cpu_v1")
    )
  )

  # Create the job with OCI
  job.create()
  # Run the job and stream the outputs
  job_run = job.run().watch()


YAML
----

You could use the following YAML example to create the same job with ``ScriptRuntime``:

.. code-block:: yaml

  kind: job
  spec:
    infrastructure:
      kind: infrastructure
      type: dataScienceJob
      spec:
        logGroupId: <log_group_ocid>
        logId: <log_ocid>
        compartmentId: <compartment_ocid>
        projectId: <project_ocid>
        subnetId: <subnet_ocid>
        shapeName: VM.Standard.E3.Flex
        shapeConfigDetails:
          memoryInGBs: 16
          ocpus: 1
        blockStorageSize: 50
    runtime:
      kind: runtime
      type: script
      spec:
        conda:
          slug: pytorch19_p37_cpu_v1
          type: service
        entrypoint: zip_or_dir/main.py
        scriptPathURI: path/to/zip_or_dir



PythonRuntime
=============

The ``PythonRuntime`` class allows you to run Python code with ADS enhanced features like configuring the working directory and Python path.  It also allows you to copy the output files to OCI Object Storage. This is especially useful for Python code involving multiple files and packages in the job artifact.

The ``PythonRuntime`` uses an ADS generated driver script as the entry point for the job run. It performs additional operations before and after invoking your code. You can examine the driver script by downloading the job artifact from the OCI Console.

Python
------

Relative to ``ScriptRunTime`` the ``PythonRuntime`` has 3 additional methods:

* ``.with_working_dir()``: Specify the working directory to use when running a job. By default, the working directory is also added to the Python paths. This should be a relative path from the parent of the job artifact directory.
* ``.with_python_path()``: Add one or more Python paths to use when running a job. The paths should be relative paths from the working directory.
* ``.with_output()``: Specify the output directory and a remote URI (for example, an OCI Object Storage URI) in the job run. Files in the output directory are copied to the remote output URI after the job run finishes successfully.

Following is an example of creating a job with ``PythonRuntime``:

.. code-block:: python3

  from ads.jobs import Job, DataScienceJOb, PythonRuntime

  job = (
    Job()
    .with_infrastructure(
      DataScienceJob()
      .with_log_group_id("<log_group_ocid>")
      .with_log_id("<log_ocid>")
      # The following infrastructure configurations are optional
      # if you are in an OCI data science notebook session.
      # The configurations of the notebook session will be used as defaults
      .with_compartment_id("<compartment_ocid>")
      .with_project_id("<project_ocid>")
      .with_subnet_id("<subnet_ocid>")
      .with_shape_name("VM.Standard.E3.Flex")
      .with_shape_config_details(memory_in_gbs=16, ocpus=1) # Applicable only for the flexible shapes
      .with_block_storage_size(50)
    )
    .with_runtime(
      PythonRuntime()
      .with_service_conda("pytorch19_p37_cpu_v1")
      # The job artifact directory is named "zip_or_dir"
      .with_source("local/path/to/zip_or_dir", entrypoint="zip_or_dir/my_package/entry.py")
      # Change the working directory to be inside the job artifact directory
      # Working directory a relative path from the parent of the job artifact directory
      # Working directory is also added to Python paths
      .with_working_dir("zip_or_dir")
      # Add an additional Python path
      # The "my_python_packages" folder is under "zip_or_dir" (working directory)
      .with_python_path("my_python_packages")
      # Files in "output" directory will be copied to OCI object storage once the job finishes
      # Here we assume "output" is a folder under "zip_or_dir" (working directory)
      .with_output("output", "oci://bucket_name@namespace/path/to/dir")
    )
  )
