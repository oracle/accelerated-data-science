Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) `Data Science <https://www.oracle.com/artificial-intelligence/data-science>`_ is a fully managed, serverless platform that empowers data science teams to build, train, and manage machine learning models on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure.

The platform features `AI Quick Actions <https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/data-science/using/ai-quick-actions.htm>`_, which enable you to deploy, evaluate, and fine-tune foundation models directly within OCI Data Science. Designed for users eager to quickly harness AI capabilities, these actions provide a streamlined, code-free, and efficient environment for working with foundation models. You can access AI Quick Actions directly from the Data Science Notebook.

Detailed documentation on deploying LLM models in OCI Data Science using AI Quick Actions is available `here <https://github.com/oracle-samples/oci-data-science-ai-samples/blob/main/ai-quick-actions/model-deployment-tips.md>`_ and `here <https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/data-science/using/ai-quick-actions-model-deploy.htm>`_.

This section provides comprehensive information on integrating OCI with **LangChain, Autogen, LlamaIndex**, and other third-party **LLM frameworks**.
