    :class: note

    It is mandatory to provide ``ocpus`` and ``memory_in_gb`` values, when deploy with Flex instance shapes. They are set in ``deployment_ocpus`` and ``deployment_memory_in_gbs`` of the ``deploy()`` method.

The ``.deploy()`` method returns a ``ModelDeployment`` object.  Specify deployment attributes such as display name, instance type, number of instances,  maximum router bandwidth, and logging groups.  The API takes the following parameters:

See :py:meth:`~ads.model.GenericModel.deploy`  for more details about the parameters.

   * Providing ``deployment_access_log_id`` and ``deployment_predict_log_id`` helps in debugging your model inference setup.
   * Default Load Balancer configuration has bandwidth of 10 Mbps. `Refer service document to help you choose the right setup. <https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/data-science/using/model_dep_create.htm>`_
   * Check for supported instance shapes `here <https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/data-science/using/supported-shapes.htm>`_ .
