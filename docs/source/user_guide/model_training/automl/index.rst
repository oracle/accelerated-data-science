Oracle AutoMLx
==============

.. note::
    Building Oracle AutoMLx models starting with oracle-ads 2.8.2, is now performed directly with the AutoMLx library. 
    AutoMLx documentation can be found `here <https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/tools/automlx/latest/html/multiversion/v23.1.1/index.html>`__. 
    Oracle AutoMLx is installed in the conda pack `automlx_p38_cpu_v#`. 
    Notebook examples are `here <https://github.com/oracle-samples/oci-data-science-ai-samples/tree/master/notebook_examples>`__ and a migration tutorial can be found in the :doc:`../../../user_guide/model_training/automl/quick_start` section.
