Ray

Ray is a framework for distributed computing in Python specialized in ML workloads. 
The documentation shows how to create a container and ``yaml`` spec to run a ``Ray``
code sample in distributed modality.

``Ray`` offers a core package to simply execute Python workloads in a distributed manner,
potentially across a cluster of machines (set up through ``Ray`` itself), but also other
extensions to perform more traditional ML computation, such as Hyperparameter Optimization.
