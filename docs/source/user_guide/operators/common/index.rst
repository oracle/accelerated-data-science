  :class: note

  Before diving into operators, let's ensure you have everything you need for easy starting. If you haven't already, install the operators and the accompanying CLI tool. Detailed installation instructions can be found in the links below.

  -  :doc:`Install ADS CLI<../../cli/quickstart>`
  -  :doc:`Configure Defaults<../../cli/opctl/configure>`

After completing the necessary prerequisites, in order to fully leverage the capabilities of operators, it may become necessary to configure :doc:`IAM Policies<./policies>` tailored to the specific environment you are working in. Nevertheless, you retain the flexibility to postpone this task until you advance to the subsequent step of executing the operators.

Utilizing our CLI tool makes it a straightforward process to explore the catalog of registered operators and gain insights into the specific challenges they address. Simply follow the :doc:`Explore Operators<./explore>` step to access further information.

After completing the exploration and configuration of operators, the next step is to execute them on your chosen backend. For more detailed instructions, please refer to the :doc:`How To Run<./run>` section.

With these comprehensive guides, you'll quickly become proficient in using operators across various environments. Don't hesitate to reach out to our support team if you encounter any issues or have questions along the way. Happy data science with operators!
