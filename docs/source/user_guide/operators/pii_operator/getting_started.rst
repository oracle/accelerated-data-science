Getting Started
===============

Configure
---------

After having set up ``ads opctl`` on your desired machine using ``ads opctl configure``, you are ready to begin using pii operator. At a bare minimum, you will need to provide the following details about your tasks:

- Path to the input data (input_data)
- Path to the output directory, where the operator will place the processed data and report.html produced from the run (output_directory)
- Name of the column with user data (target_column)
- The detector will be used in the operator (detectors)

You can check :ref:`Configure Detector <config_detector>` for more details on how to configure ``detectors`` parameter. These details exactly match the initial pii.yaml file generated by running ``ads operator init --type pii``:

.. code-block:: yaml

    kind: operator
    type: pii
    version: v1
    spec:
        input_data:
            url: mydata.csv
        target_column: target
        output_directory:
            url: result/
        detectors:
            - name: default.phone
              action: mask


Optionally, you are able to specify much more. The most common additions are:

- Whether to show sensitive content in the report (show_sensitive_content)
- Way to process the detected entity (action)

An extensive list of parameters can be found in the :ref:`YAML Schema <pii-yaml-schema>`.


Run
---

After you have your pii.yaml written, you simply run the operator using:

.. code-block:: bash

    ads operator run -f pii.yaml


Interpret Results
-----------------

The pii operator produces the following output files: ``mydata-out.csv`` and ``report.html``.

We will go through each of these output files in turn.

**mydata-out.csv**

The name of this file can be customized based on ``output_directory`` parameters in the configuration yaml. This file contains the processed dataset.

**report.html**

The report.html file is customized based on report parameters in the configuration yaml. It contains a summary of statistics, a plot of entities distributions, details of the resolved entites, and details about any modelused. By default sensitive information is not shown in the report, but for debugging purposes you can disable this with ``show_sensitive_content``. It also includes a copy of YAML file, providing a fully detailed version of the original specification.
